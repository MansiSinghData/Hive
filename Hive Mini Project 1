1. Create a schema based on the given dataset

create table agentLogingReport(
SL_NO int,
AGENT string,
DATE string,
LOGIN_TIME string,
LOGOUT_TIME string,
DURATION string
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1")



create table agentPerformance(
SL_NO int,
DATE string,
AGENT_NAME String,
TOTAL_CHATS int,
AVG_RESPONSE_TIME string,
AVG_RESOLUTION_TIME string,
AVG_RATING float,
TOTAL_FEEDBACK int)
row format delimited 
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1")
;


2. Dump the data inside the hdfs in the given schema location.

load data local inpath 'file:///home/cloudera/pract/AgentLogingReport.csv' into table agentLogingReport;

Load data local inpath "file:///home/cloudera/pract/AgentPerformance.csv" into table agentPerformance;

3. List of all agents' names.

select distinct(agent_name) from agentPerformance;

4. Find out agent average rating.

select agent_name,avg(avg_rating) as AVG_RATING from agentPerformance group by agent_name;

5. Total working days for each agents

select agent,count(date) as Working_days from agentLogingReport group by agent;

6. Total query that each agent have taken 

select agent_name,sum(total_chats) as total_queries_taken from agentperformance group by agent_name;

7. Total Feedback that each agent have received 

select agent_name,sum(total_feedback) as feedback_recieved_taken from agentperformance group by agent_name;

8. Agent name who have average rating between 3.5 to 4

select agent_name,avg(case when avg_rating<>0 then avg_rating else null end) as Avg_rating from agentperformance group by agent_name having avg_rating>=3.5 and avg_rating<=4;

9. Agent name who have rating less than 3.5

select agent_name,avg(case when avg_rating<>0 then avg_rating else null end) as Avg_rating from agentperformance group by agent_name having avg_rating<3.5;

10. Agent name who have rating more than 4.5

select agent_name,avg(case when avg_rating<>0 then avg_rating else null end) as Avg_rating from agentperformance group by agent_name having avg_rating>4.5;

11. How many feedback agents have received more than 4.5 average

select agent_name,sum(total_feedback) as total_feedback_recieved from (select agent_name,avg(case when avg_rating<>0 then avg_rating else null end) over 
(partition by agent_name) as Avg_rating,total_feedback from agentperformance group by agent_name having avg_rating>4.5) a group by agent_name;

12. average weekly response time for each agent 

select agent_name,weekofyear(date) as week_number,int(round(avg(unix_timestamp(AVG_RESPONSE_TIME,"HH:mm:ss")-28800))) as AVGerage_RESPONSE_TIME from agent_performance group by agent_name,weekofyear(date);

13. average weekly resolution time for each agents 

select agent_name,weekofyear(date) as week_number,int(round(avg(unix_timestamp(avg_resolution_time,"HH:mm:ss")-28800))) as average_resolution_time from agent_performance group by agent_name,weekofyear(date);

14.Find the number of chat on which they have received a feedback

select agent_name,sum(total_feedback) as feedback_recieved_taken from agentperformance group by agent_name;

15. Total contribution hour for each and every agents weekly basis 

select agent,weekofyear(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(date,'dd-MMM-yy'),'yyyy-MM-dd')) as week_num,int(round(sum(unix_timestamp(duration,"HH:mm:ss")-28800)))
as total_time_spent_in_sec from agentlogingreport group by agent,weekofyear(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(date,'dd-MMM-yy'),'yyyy-MM-dd')) ;

16. Perform inner join, left join and right join based on the agent column and after joining the table export that data into your local system.


17. Perform partitioning on top of the agent column and then on top of that perform bucketing for each partitioning.
